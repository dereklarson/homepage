- I produced pioneering work in exploring how a disordered solid phase permits superfluidity. Implementing two advanced Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, I mapped out a rich phase diagram for a key spin model, which exhibits six distinct phases including the coexistence of glass and superfluid phases.
