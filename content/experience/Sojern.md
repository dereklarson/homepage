- Optimizing Ad Audiences via Machine Learning
  - A ML pipeline tranching users by a quality score based on web history
  - I took over an ongoing effort, redesigned it for new model types and speed
  - Our A/B tests demonstrated 25% cost reduction across enterprise clients
  - Improved pipeline efficiency 1000x (it didn't start very efficient ;)
- Automated Optimization System for Enterprise Ad Campaigns
  - Supplies daily performance adjustments and provide alerts and insights
  - I led the engineering effort as primary designer and developer
  - Deployed to 95% of campaigns and improved key metrics 3x vs human control
- Platform for dynamically creating and managing custom advertising audiences
  - Allows users to specify their own audience logic with 1-click deployment
  - I pitched the project, developed a custom metalanguage and built the backend
  - Freed up 2-3 full-time engineers from coding the same audiences manually
