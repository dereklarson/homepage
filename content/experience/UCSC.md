- I contributed to the long-standing debate on how applied magnetic fields interact with the spin glass phase and to the hypothesized duality between structural and spin glasses. In addition, I explored algorithms which could more efficiently simulate spin glasses and which can accurately measure the long tail of probability distributions.
